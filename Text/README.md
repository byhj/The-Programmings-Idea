# Title: Reverse a String

Difficulty: 1
Description: Create a program that asks the user for a string of input and simply returns it in
reverse order. For instance they enter “Hello” and it returns “olleH”.
Tips: Keep in mind that a string is often treated as an array of individual characters. In C/C++
based languages this list ends with a terminating character ‘\0’. One of the fastest ways to
reverse a string is simply to swap each character as you work your way inward. So for instance,
you would swap “H” with “o” and then “e” with “l” etc. To do this, use a loop that continues until
the start meets or surpasses the end. Make sure not to swap the terminator itself!
